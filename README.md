# Premier League Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an end-to-end data analysis of the English Premier League 2024-25 season data. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and modeling
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing and utility functions
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models
- **visualizations/**: Generated plots and charts
- **dashboard/**: Interactive dashboard files

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection & Integration**: Working with Premier League dataset and additional sources
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding data distributions and relationships
3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying probability and statistical techniques
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models
7. **Dashboard Creation**: Developing an interactive dashboard to present findings

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Statistical Analysis (SciPy)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Dashboard Development (Streamlit)
